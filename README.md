Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. The core idea is to prevent multiple instances of the class from being created, thus saving memory and ensuring consistent access to a single instance.
Key Features of Singleton Pattern:
•	Single Instance: Only one instance of the class is created.
•	Global Access: Provides a global point of access to the instance.
•	Controlled Instantiation: Instantiation is controlled by the class itself.
Lazy Holder Pattern
The Lazy Holder pattern, often used as a variant of the Singleton pattern, involves delaying the creation of the instance until it is first needed. This can improve performance and resource utilization, particularly in scenarios where the instance might never be used.

Key Features of Lazy Holder Pattern:
•	Lazy Initialization: The instance is created only when it is first accessed.
•	Thread Safety: Often ensures thread-safe lazy initialization.
•	Delayed Resource Allocation: Resources are allocated only when needed, which can be beneficial for performance.
Differences between the two: 
Initialization Time:
•	Singleton: Instance is typically created at the time of class loading or when the application starts, depending on the implementation.
•	Lazy Holder: Instance is created the first time it is accessed, not at the time of class loading.
Resource Utilization:
•	Singleton: Resources are allocated as soon as the instance is created, which can be inefficient if the instance is not used immediately or at all.
•	Lazy Holder: Resources are allocated only when needed, which can be more efficient.
Implementation Complexity:
•	Singleton: Generally straightforward to implement but can require careful handling to ensure thread safety.
•	Lazy Holder: Can be more complex to implement, especially when ensuring thread safety during the first access.
Thread Safety:
•	Singleton: Requires explicit handling of thread safety during instance creation.
•	Lazy Holder: Can encapsulate thread safety within the lazy initialization logic.
